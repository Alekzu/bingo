# Bingo Ambiental

# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Alekzu/bingo.git
    $ cd mysite
If you don't have django installed for python 3 then run:

    $ pip3 install django

You can now run the development server:

    $ python manage.py runserver
    
Or Activate the virtualenv for your project.
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt
    
    
Then simply apply the migrations:

    $ python manage.py migrate
